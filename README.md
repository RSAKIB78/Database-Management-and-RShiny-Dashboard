## General Information
The goal of this project is to examine the complete process of extracting, refining and delivering datasets extracted from databases and unstructured data sources (e.g., unstructured files and the web). 

The project is structured in three (3) parts. The first part (Part A) covers structured data and in particular the design of databases and the extraction of data using structured query language (SQL). It aims to implement the principles of relational databases and in particular: normalization, relational mapping, absorption of business rules on the relational view etc. The core of this project involves the translation of business requirements to data management solutions. The second and third parts (Part B and Part C) involves the management of unstructured data sourced by semi-structured data files such as spreadsheets (Part B) and the extraction of data from web sources (Part C).
